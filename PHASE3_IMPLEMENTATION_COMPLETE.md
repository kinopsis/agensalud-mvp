## 🔒 Security & Multi-Tenant Compliance

### **Row Level Security (RLS)** ✅
- All new API endpoints respect existing RLS policies
- Organization-based data isolation maintained
- SuperAdmin analytics provide cross-organization insights while maintaining security
- API documentation filtered by user role and permissions

### **Role-Based Access Control** ✅
- API documentation available to all authenticated users (filtered by role)
- SuperAdmin analytics restricted to SuperAdmin role only
- Proper error responses for unauthorized access
- Permission validation at both UI and API levels

### **Data Security** ✅
- **Analytics**: Aggregated data only, no sensitive personal information exposed
- **API Docs**: Role-based filtering prevents exposure of unauthorized endpoints
- **Caching**: Secure caching headers with appropriate expiration times
