3. **User testing** - Validation and improvement

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: The current MVP, while technically excellent, lacks the AI-first differentiation that defines the product vision and market positioning.

**Priority 1**: Implement landing page and basic chatbot to establish market presence and demonstrate AI capabilities.

**Priority 2**: Complete natural language booking flow to deliver the core value proposition.

**Priority 3**: Add intelligent features to create sustainable competitive advantage.

Without these AI features, the product cannot validate its core hypothesis or compete effectively in the market as an "AI-first" solution. The technical foundation is solid - now we need to build the AI layer that makes this product unique and valuable.

---

**Next Steps**: Begin with landing page implementation to establish market presence, then rapidly iterate on AI features based on user feedback and market response.
